\title{Import xlsx (Excel) cell contents into a tidy structure.}
\usage{
xlsx_cells(path, sheets = NA, check_filetype = TRUE,
  include_blank_cells = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Path to the xlsx file.}

\item{sheets}{Sheets to read. Either a character vector (the names of the
sheets), an integer vector (the positions of the sheets), or NA (default, all
sheets).}

\item{check_filetype}{Logical. Whether to check that the filetype is xlsx (or
xlsm) by looking at the file itself, rather than using the filename
extension.}

\item{include_blank_cells}{Logical. Whether to include cells that have no
value or formula (but might have formatting or comments).  Useful when a
whole column of cells has been formatted, but most are empty.  Try setting
this to \code{FALSE} if a spreadsheet seems too large to load.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns.
\itemize{
\item \code{sheet} The worksheet that the cell is from.
\item \code{address} The cell address in A1 notation.
\item \code{row} The row number of a cell address (integer).
\item \code{col} The column number of a cell address (integer).
\item \code{is_blank} Whether or not the cell has a value
\item \code{data_type} The type of a cell, referring to the following columns:
error, logical, numeric, date, character, blank.
\item \code{error} The error value of a cell.
\item \code{logical} The boolean value of a cell.
\item \code{numeric} The numeric value of a cell.
\item \code{date} The date value of a cell.
\item \code{character} The string value of a cell.
\item \code{formula} The formula in a cell (see 'Details').
\item \code{is_array} Whether or not the formula is an array formula.
\item \code{formula_ref} The address of a range of cells group to which an array
formula or shared formula applies (see 'Details').
\item \code{formula_group} The formula group to which the cell belongs (see
'Details').
\item \code{comment} The text of a comment attached to a cell.
\item \code{height} The height of a cell's row, in Excel's units.
\item \code{width} The width of a cell's column, in Excel's units.
\item \code{style_format} An index into a table of style formats
\code{x$formats$style} (see 'Details').
\item \code{local_format_id} An index into a table of local cell formats
\code{x$formats$local} (see 'Details').
}

Cell formatting is returned in \code{\link[tidyxl:xlsx_formats]{tidyxl::xlsx_formats()}}.  There are two types
or scopes of formatting: 'style' formatting, such as Excel's built-in styles
'normal', 'bad', etc., and 'local' formatting, which overrides particular
elements of the style, e.g. by making it bold.  Both types are returned, in
the \code{$style} and \code{$local} sublists of \code{\link[tidyxl:xlsx_formats]{tidyxl::xlsx_formats()}}, with
identical structures.  To look up the local formatting of a given cell, take
the cell's 'local_format_id' value (\code{my_cells$data$Sheet1[1, "local_format_id"]}), and use it as an index into the format structure.  E.g.
to look up the font size, \code{my_formats$local$font$size[local_format_id]}.  To
see all available formats, type \code{str(my_formats$local)}.

\description{
\code{xlsx_cells()} imports data from spreadsheets without coercing it into a
rectangle.  Each cell is represented by a row in a data frame, giving the
cell's address, contents, formula, height, width, and keys to look up the
cell's formatting in the return value of \code{\link[tidyxl:xlsx_formats]{tidyxl::xlsx_formats()}}.
}
\details{
A cell has two 'values': its content, and sometimes also a formula.  It also
has formatting applied at the 'style' level, which can be locally overridden.

\subsection{Content}{
Depending on the cell, the content may be a numeric value such as 365 or
365.25, it may represent a date/datetime in one of Excel's date/datetime
systems, or it may be an index into an internal table of strings.
\code{xlsx_cells()} attempts to infer the correct data type of each cell,
returning its value in the appropriate column (error, logical, numeric,
date, character). In case this cleverness is unhelpful, the unparsed value
and type information is available in the 'content' and 'type' columns.
}

\subsection{Formula}{
When a cell has a formula, the value in the 'content' column is the result
of the formula the last time it was evaluated.

Certain groups of cells may share a formula that differs only by addresses
referred to in the formula; such groups are identified by an index, the
'formula_group'.  The xlsx (Excel) file format only records the formula
against one cell in any group.  \code{xlsx_cells()} propagates such formulas to
the other cells in a group, making the necessary changes to relative
addresses in the formula.

Array formulas may also apply to a group of cells, identified by an address
'formula_ref', but xlsx (Excel) file format only records the formula
against one cell in the group.  \code{xlsx_cells()} propagates such formulas to
the other cells in a group.  Unlike shared formulas, no changes to
addresses in array formulas are necessary.

Formulas that refer to other workbooks currently do not name the workbooks
directly, instead via indices such as \code{[1]}.  It is planned to
dereference these.
}

\subsection{Formatting}{
Cell formatting is returned by \code{\link[tidyxl:xlsx_formats]{tidyxl::xlsx_formats()}}.  There are two
types of formatting: 'style' formatting, such as Excel's built-in styles
'normal', 'bad', etc., and 'local' formatting, which overrides the style.
These are returned in the \code{$style} and \code{$local} sublists of
\code{\link[tidyxl:xlsx_formats]{tidyxl::xlsx_formats()}}, with identical structures.

To look up the local formatting of a given cell, take the cell's
\code{local_format_id} value (\code{my_cells$Sheet1[1, "local_format_id"]}), and use
it as an index into the format structure.  E.g. to look up the font size,
\code{my_formats$local$font$size[local_format_id]}.  To see all available
formats, type \code{str(my_formats$local)}.

Strings can be formatted within a cell, so that a single cell can contain
substrings with different formatting.  This in-cell formatting is available
in the column \code{character_formatted}, which is a list-column of data frames.
Each row of each data frame describes a substring and its formatting.  For
cells without a character value, \code{character_formatted} is \code{NULL}, so for
further processing you might need to filter out the \code{NULL}s first.

# All sheets
str(xlsx_cells(examples))

# Specific sheet either by position or by name
str(xlsx_cells(examples, 2))
str(xlsx_cells(examples, "Sheet1"))

# The formats of particular cells can be retrieved like this:

formats <- xlsx_formats(examples)

formats$local$font$bold[Sheet1$local_format_id]
formats$style$font$bold[Sheet1$style_format]

# To filter for cells of a particular format, first filter the formats to get
# the relevant indices, and then filter the cells by those indices.
bold_indices <- which(formats$local$font$bold)
Sheet1[Sheet1$local_format_id \%in\% bold_indices, ]

# In-cell formatting is available in the `character_formatted` column as a
# data frame, one row per substring.
